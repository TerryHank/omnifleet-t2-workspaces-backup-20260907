# OmniFleet map TF generator

Organized under `src/map/` following Autoware Universe's map-domain package layout.
Autoware's corresponding package generates a map viewer frame; this package preserves
OmniFleet's existing map/fleet transforms rather than copying that visualization algorithm.

- `transforms.py`: planar angle/pose normalization, composition and inverse.
- `map_tf.py`: constructs map-related TransformStamped messages.
- `grid_codec.py`: lossless shared-grid encoding, decoding and QOS.

Existing MSC nodes continue to own the publishers and all validity conditions. This package
starts no node and creates no broadcaster. It adds no competing TF publisher.
MOLA's vehicle localization output, sensor extrinsics, fleet safety and transport stay in their
existing domains. `omnifleet_msc.geometry` and `omnifleet_msc.shared_map` keep compatibility imports.

Existing frames and topics are retained, including reference map -> fleet_map,
fleet_map -> robot map, fleet_map -> fleet_pose and the existing optional map -> odom bridge.
