# Robot 113 source snapshot

Tag: `robot113-source-20261013-111614`. Source: `iecme@192.168.3.113:/home/iecme/omnifleet_ws`.
Snapshot completed (Asia/Shanghai): 2026-10-13T11:16:14.748987+08:00.

This tag contains a new source-snapshot commit. The source layout is retained under `src/`, alongside workspace `env.bash`.
Linux symlinks and executable flags are retained in Git. Windows checkouts can represent symlinks as text; use Linux for restoration.

## Included

Current source/configuration selected from the canonical workspace, plus `env.bash`.
See `BACKUP_MANIFEST.json` for per-file SHA256, modes, symbolic-link targets, exclusions, and redactions.

## Excluded / separate restore requirements

Build/install/log, nested Git histories, dependency caches, virtual environments, node_modules,
desktop distribution binaries, archives, model weights, maps outside src, recordings, credentials,
and historical backup copies. External systemd/configuration, model/map assets and runtime state must be backed up separately.
Some configuration secret values have been replaced with `REDACTED_BACKUP_SECRET`; provision real secrets outside Git.

This is a source backup, not an image of the robot or evidence that rebuilding and real-robot navigation pass.
